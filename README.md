# Freelancer Friday Flections

Retrospective-like agenda for Freelancer Friday (re)Flections

This now lives in a wider, more people, form over here: [Freelancer Friday 'Flections organisation on GitHub](https://github.com/Freelancer-Friday-Flections/).

---

The goal of the weekly FFFs is help us look back at this week and **inspect and adapt**. We keep it to **30 mins** to make sure we're focused, and to leave a bit of time for chit-chat if we like :).

We follow this broad pattern:

- Diverge;
- Spot patterns;
- Converge.

## The structure

1. What went well? (5m)
- What could I do differently? (5m)
- What did I learn? (5m)
- *(Optional!) Round Robin: share 1 thing (5m)*
- SMART goal (to be done by the next FFF) (5m)
